# SecuScan
As blockchain technology gains traction, security vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to
high-profile exploits, costing billions in financial losses. SecuScan is an AI-powered Smart
Contract Security Analyzer designed to identify and mitigate security risks in Ethereum-based
contracts before deployment. By integrating Slither, Mythril, and Echidna, SecuScan performs
static and dynamic analysis to detect vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows,
access control flaws, and gas inefficiencies.
Developers often lack deep security expertise, leading to unintentionally vulnerable smart
contracts. SecuScan provides real-time risk assessment, categorizing vulnerabilities as
Critical, High, Medium, or Low, along with actionable remediation guides. Its AI-driven
insights offer best-practice recommendations, ensuring that contracts follow secure coding
standards. The platform includes a sandboxed testnet simulation, allowing users to execute
contracts in a controlled environment and observe potential attack scenarios.
The web-based dashboard, built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, offers an intuitive interface
where developers upload contracts, receive security scores, and access detailed reports.
Additionally, SecuScan features a gas optimization module, highlighting inefficient functions
and suggesting performance improvements. Secure contract reports can be stored using
MongoDB or Firebase for easy tracking.
SecuScan is not just a security toolâ€”it is a developer-friendly auditing assistant,
democratizing smart contract security and helping prevent financial disasters in DeFi, NFT, and
DAO ecosystems. By providing a comprehensive, easy-to-use security suite, SecuScan
empowers developers to write secure and efficient smart contracts, reinforcing trust in
blockchain applications. ðŸš€
